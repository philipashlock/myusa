At the core, we’re looking for ways to improve the way people and government connect at the most fundamental level and we want to hear from everyone, young and old, across the country. We also want to develop this collaboratively, so we want to hear from the civic hackers, the platform developers, the user experience gurus, the folks in technology, entertainment, design (TED, anyone?), and everyone in between.

If you’ve ever been to the post office, visited a government website, or applied for financial aid and thought, “Why did they do it this way?” or “I wish they’d thought of...” then we want to hear from you!
